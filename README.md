# Kmean
Welcome to the K-Means Clustering implementation repository in MATLAB. In this project, we'll explore the K-Means clustering algorithm, a widely used technique for partitioning data into distinct clusters based on similarity.2. K-Means Algorithm

In this implementation, we'll follow these steps:

    Initialization: Randomly select K initial cluster centroids from the dataset.

    Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.

    Update Centroids: Recalculate the centroids based on the mean of data points in each cluster.

    Iteration: Repeatedly perform assignment and centroid update until convergence or a maximum number of iterations.
